Installing the Auth0 module
---------------------------

Auth0 requires some additional PHP packages to function. These packages are 
managed by Composer (https://getcomposer.org/) and must be installed before
you can use this module. There are 2 ways to install these packages:

1) Directly with Composer
If you have composer already installed you can run:
  
  > composer install

from inside the module directory. Composer will then download and install all
of the required dependencies.

2) With Composer Manager
Composer Manager (https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_manager) is a Drupal
module to help with the management of dependencies across all installed modules.

Follow the Composer Manager instructions: https://www.drupal.org/node/2405805
to install Composer Manager and use it to download and install the Auth0 module
dependencies.
